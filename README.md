# Punctual App

This is my first beginner app that involved learning about basic widgets such as the images, color, and buttons. This allowed me to be creative with the concept of a watermelon design that I wanted. This app basically gets people out the door by 15 minutes providing steps to check for esentials and just important stuff to do before heading out the door. Simple concept of just UI interaction and that's basically it.
